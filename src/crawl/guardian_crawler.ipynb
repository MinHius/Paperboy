And can Britain be put on a war footing without taxes going up?\\nHealey  says the government cannot turn around the situation overnight.\\nThe government has set out its plans. And it has a “Nato first” commitment, because the UK won’t fight alone.\\nPrivate investment is rising too, he says.\\n10.19am  GMT\\nHealey  is now taking questions.\\nQ: How close are are we to war?\\nHealey  says the threats to the UK are rising. That is why Labour proposed at the election raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, a level not seen since Labour was last in office. He says the government wants to raise that to 3% in the next parliament.\\n10.17am  GMT\\nHealey  says the other main parties cannot be trusted on defence.\\nHe says the Tories would cut defence, as they did in the past. The Greens would pull the UK out of Nato, he claims.\\n(In fact, official Green policy is not to withdraw from Nato.)\\nThe SNP spurn our military, he says (in reference to their opposition to the nuclear deterrent.)\\nAnd he says Nigel Farage is week on Vladimir Putin.\\nHe ends:\\nIt is Labour that is the party of defence.\\n10.14am  GMT\\nHealey is now giving details of the plan for new munitions factories announced today.\\nThere are more details in an MoD news release  here .\\n10.12am  GMT\\nJohn Healey , the defence secretary, has been highlighting government achievements since the election in his speech in Downing Street this morning.\\nHe says the armed forces have had the largest pay rise for 20 years, defence spending has increased by the largest amount since the cold war, 36,000 MoD homes have been brought back into public ownership, the government has helped set up a coalition of the willing for Ukraine, and it has forged a defence partnership with the EU, he says.\\n10.10am  GMT\\nKeir Starmer  has told his son how “proud” he is of him and how he enjoys sharing a takeaway in a video message to mark international men’s day.\\nAs PA Media reports, the prime minister talked of his strained relationship with his own father but said he had always been determined that his bond with own son “was going to be different”.\\nIn a video letter posted to Instagram, Sir Keir tells his son, who he does not name in public:\\nIt feels like only yesterday that we brought you home, so nervous but so excited for the journey ahead.\\nToday, almost unbelievably, you’re already 17. You’re taller than I am and you’ve grown into a confident, kind, wonderful young man, and I’m so proud of you.\\nI didn’t have a very close relationship with my own dad.\\nWhen my mum, your grandma Jo, was sick, and she was very sick, he cared for her devotedly, but he and I never really spoke, we never really got to know each other.\\nI was determined that my relationship with you was going to be different and spending time with you is one of the highlights of my week, whether it’s a takeaway or going to watch Arsenal.\\n10.03am  GMT\\nJohn Healey , the defence secretary, is giving his press conference now.\\nThere is a live feed here.\\n9.45am  GMT\\nMinister says MoD looking at security risk from Chinese cars, but staff told to avoid secret talk in any vehicle\\nIn an interview on LBC this morning  Luke Pollard , a defence minister, was asked about Tan Dhesi’s claim that MoD officials have been told not to discuss secrets in Chinese cars. (See  9.05am .)\\nPollard said the MoD was “looking into Chinese vehicles within our fleets”. But security was an issue in all modern cars, he said.\\nWe have a fleet of tens of thousands of vehicles in the Ministry of Defence and those vehicles [Chinese ones] represent a very small number.\\nBut whether you’re driving a Chinese car or a non Chinese car, what we’ve asked our people to do is not plug Ministry of Defence technology into their vehicle, not to have conversations at a secret classification in any vehicle, due to the increasing threats of surveillance that exist in every single vehicle, to only have those secret conversations in secure locations. That’s a prudent and reasonable thing for anyone concerned about [security].\\nWhen it was put to him that it would be prudent for the MoD to stop using all Chinese vehicles, Pollard replied: ‘That’s precisely what we’re investigating at the moment.”\\nUpdated  at 9.53am GMT\\n9.09am  GMT\\nLack of planning has hit Labour’s efforts to fix public services, says thinktank\\nKeir Starmer is failing to make major improvements to public services partly because he did not plan properly while in opposition, according to a report from the  Institute for Government  (IfG).\\nKiran Stacey  has the story here.\\nHere is  the IfG report.\\nAnd here is its scorecard on how the main public services are performing.\\nUpdated  at 9.10am GMT\\n9.05am  GMT\\nAt his press conference this morning John Healey may be asked about this claim, from  Tan Dhesi , the Labour chair of the defence committee. On Newsnight last night he said that MoD officials have been told not to discuss secret or classified information while travelling in Chinese cars.\\nIn the Commons yesterday  Alicia Kearns , a shadow Home Office minister,  said  that earlier this month “Norway and Denmark alerted us to the existence of dual-use kill switches in Chinese-made electric buses” and that these would allow “China to switch off buses and bring chaos to transport systems”.\\n8.50am  GMT\\nUK lacks defence strategy, MPs say, as plan unveiled for more weapons factories\\nGood morning. Rachel Reeves will be unveiling her budget a week today, but the rollout of budget-related news has already started and this morning  John Healey , the defence secretary, will hold a press conference to announce that the government has identified 13 sites for new munitions factories.\\nIn a news release, the  Ministry of Defence  says Healey will commit to “building the factories of the future in Britain” and expects industry to break ground on the first energetics factory in the next year. The MoD says:\\nThe defence secretary will confirm that MoD has now funded a number of feasibility studies for the new energetics factories to kickstart high-volume energetics production at scale for the first time in nearly two decades. The engineering design work on the first of these factories has been commissioned with a view to start production for UK armed forces and to enable our continued support to Ukraine. Potential sites include Grangemouth in Scotland, Teesside in Northeast England, and Milton Haven in Wales. The factories will produce the components essential for bolstering the UK’s weapons arsenal including propellants, explosives and pyrotechnics.\\n“Energetics” are weapon parts, including propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics.\\nHealey  will also say that the decisions in the budget will ensure there is no return to the “hollowed out and underfunded” armed forces of the past.\\nAnd about time too, the  Commons defence committee  says (sort of). In a report out today, it says  Britain does not have a plan to defend itself from attacks . It says:\\nThe UK’s defence industrial base is not yet configured for sustained collective defence. It faces challenges in capacity, skills, innovation, procurement, and financing. The SDR [strategic defence review] and defence industrial strategy outline a reform agenda, but implementation will be key. The government must ensure that defence finance is accessible, predictable, and resilient— including for SMEs and start-ups.\\nThe UK lacks a plan for defending the homeland and overseas territories with little progress on the home defence programme. The prime minister’s ‘national conversation on defence and security’, highlighted in the SDR, is yet to start. The proposed defence readiness bill, vital to empower government in the event of crisis or conflict, has not yet been written. The government must improve cross-departmental coordination, clarify responsibilities, and engage the public meaningfully in preparedness efforts.\\nHere is the agenda for the day.\\n9.15am:  Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, gives evidence to the Commons work and pensions committee.\\n10am:  John Healey, the defence secretary, holds a press conference in Downing Street to announce investment in armaments production.\\nNoon:  Keir Starmer faces Kemi Badenoch at PMQs.\\n2pm:  John Swinney, the Scottish first minister, speaks at an Institute for Government event.\\nAfternoon:  Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, holds a press conference in Berlin with her German counterpart, Johann Wadephul.\\nIf you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word.\\nIf you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has  given up posting from its official accounts on X , but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary.\\nI find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.\\nUpdated  at 9.10am GMT', 'author': 'Andrew Sparrow'}\n"

      "Trail text: The world’s top two players, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, will face one another in the climax of the ATP Finals in Turin\n",
      "body: The 2025 men’s tennis season will conclude with a final showdown between the two best players in the world after Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz reached the final of the ATP Finals.   Sinner continued his total dominance of the indoor season as the Italian held off an admirable early challenge from Alex de Minaur before bulldozing his path into the tournament’s final for a third consecutive year with a supreme 7-5, 6-2 win, a victory that extended his winning record against the Australian to 13-0.     In the evening, Alcaraz followed his great rival’s lead by putting together an excellent performance, defeating the in-form Félix Auger-Aliassime 6-2, 6-4 to reach the final. This is uncharted territory for the Spaniard, who will compete in the title match of the Association of Tennis Professionals’ season-ending tournament for the first time.   Earlier this week, Alcaraz sealed the year-end No 1 ranking ahead of Sinner by rolling through his round-robin group with a flawless 3-0 record. He will attempt to close out his individual season, by far the best of his career, by winning an incredible ninth title of 2025.   No matter how things play out, this is a fitting climax to a year that has been defined by the dominance of the two rivals. Alcaraz and Sinner have split the four grand slam tournaments between them for the second consecutive year, with Sinner winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon while Alcaraz took the French Open and US Open.   Either Alcaraz or Sinner has won the last seven tournaments when both players have been present in the draw and they have faced each other in six finals this year. Alcaraz has won seven of their last eight meetings, establishing a 10-5 overall lead, meaning Sinner will be looking to definitively halt Alcaraz’s momentum in the match-up.   Sinner continues to perform at such a consistent, high level that has allowed him to rapidly rise up the list of all-time great men’s tennis players. In a season that included a three-month doping ban between February and May, Sinner will attempt to win his sixth ATP title of the year in his 10th final. The 24-year-old has won 30 consecutive indoor hard court matches and 14 matches in a row after his recent triumphs at the Vienna Open and Paris Masters. He has also won 18 consecutive sets at the ATP Finals.   “Making three times consecutive finals in Turin means a lot to me,” said Sinner. “It’s a great atmosphere, great place for me to play tennis and also a great place for me to close this beautiful season I’ve played in. Tomorrow I will enjoy, I will obviously try my best to get the best possible result but in any case, it has been again an amazing week.”   De Minaur arrived in the semi-final with few reasons to believe he could even make things difficult for Sinner, an opponent he has won just two sets against in their 13 meetings. Their form this week only further illustrated the challenge before him. While the Australian barely survived the group stages, qualifying through tie-break rules despite losing two of his three matches, Sinner eased through his group without dropping a set.   For more than an hour, however, De Minaur threw everything he could at the Italian, playing some of his best tennis of the tournament in the process. He forced himself inside the baseline, frequently having to half-volley ground strokes as he tried to maintain his court position. The Australian also served well, saving Sinner’s first seven break points as they reached 5-5, and he used his stupendous defensive skills to make the court seem as narrow as possible to his opponent.   His best efforts were far from sufficient. As has been the case every time they have faced each other, Sinner completely overpowered De Minaur with far more potent ground strokes. He also continued his own brilliant serving form during the tournament, emerging from their tight opening set having landed 82% of his first serves. With the first set secured, Sinner opened his shoulders and hit his helpless opponent off the court to reach another final in front of his buoyant home crowd.\n",
