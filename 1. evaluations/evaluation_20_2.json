It logically progresses from the first televised debate on October 16, 2025, to the final televised debate on October 22, 2025, featuring Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The selected articles provide significant and informative coverage of the key issues, candidate clashes, and overall dynamics of these crucial pre-election events. Articles de-noised include a general US politics update (Article 5), a tangential piece about Mamdani's public persona at a football event (Article 6), and other articles detailing various individual campaign events, interviews, or specific political stances of Zohran Mamdani (Articles 7, 8, 9, 10). While these de-noised articles are related to the broader mayoral race or candidates, they do not contribute to the strict \"continuous and developmental\" narrative of the mayoral debates and would dilute the synthesizability of this specific story.\",\n    \"score\": 10\n}"
