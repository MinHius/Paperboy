  "evaluation": "The core topic of this cluster is the multifaceted impact of Artificial Intelligence on children and teenagers, spanning concerns about safety, educational implications, and developmental effects. The qualified articles demonstrate a clear narrative about AI chatbots causing harm (bullying, encouraging self-harm), tech companies like Meta responding with safeguards, pupils' fears about AI eroding study skills and creativity, and the integration of AI into educational models through 'AI-powered' schools. The noise articles were de-noised for several reasons: 'are-we-living-in-a-golden-age-of-stupidity-technology' is too general, discussing broader technological advancements rather than AI's specific impact on youth. 'im-suddenly-so-angry-my-strange-unnerving-week-with-an-ai-friend' focuses on an adult's personal interaction with an AI companion, which is outside the scope of AI's impact on children. 'instagram-parental-guidance-pg-13-age-rating-system-meta' discusses general content filtering on Instagram for teens, not specifically related to AI chatbots or AI's direct influence. Finally, 'gruesome-videos-social-media-distressing-news-children-survey' addresses the issue of distressing content on social media in general, without a specific focus on AI's role.",
