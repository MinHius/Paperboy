  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively captures the continuous story of Moldova's pivotal parliamentary election in late September 2025. The core narrative spans from the pre-election build-up and its significance for the country's pro-EU path versus Russian influence (Articles 6, 2, 8), through the election day and initial results (Article 3), to the final outcome and post-election analysis, including condemnation of Russian interference (Articles 1, 4, 5, 7). The timeline is logical and developmental. Articles 9 (Czech Republic election) and 10 (Estonia city election and Russian threats) were de-noised as they cover entirely distinct political events in different countries, bearing no direct relevance or developmental connection to the Moldova election story.",
