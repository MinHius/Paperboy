    "For hours, jolting along the waterlogged dirt track to the hospital, 18-year-old Makka Ibraheem Mohammed held on tight to her seat and focused on stopping herself vomiting. She was in labour, in extreme pain after her uterus ruptured, but was now being tossed around in the ambulance that jumped along the dips and bumps of the road through the Chadian desert.   Most of the  878,000 Sudanese refugees who have fled to Chad  since 2023, living hand to mouth in this harsh landscape, are women. They stay in isolated camps in the desert with limited water and food, no work and with medical help often a life-threateningly long distance away.   The hospital Mohammed needed, run by the aid agency Médec"

  "evaluation": "The core cluster centers around the escalating civil war in Sudan and its profound humanitarian crisis. Articles detail the initial horrors of people fleeing conflict zones like Nyala, the prolonged and devastating siege of El Fasher (with updates on its uninhabitable state and critical malnourishment), and the broader displacement crisis affecting Sudanese refugees in Chad and South Sudanese returning from Sudan, exacerbated by aid cuts. These articles collectively offer a continuous, developmental narrative on the conflict's impact. The articles concerning Afghanistan (internet shutdowns, a judge fleeing the Taliban, and Afghan refugees in Iran) were deemed noise as they pertain to a distinct geographical conflict and are irrelevant to the Sudan crisis. None of the articles were minigames or non-informative content.",
