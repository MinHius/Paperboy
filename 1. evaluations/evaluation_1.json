  "evaluation": "This cluster was evaluated for continuous stories focusing on England's sports news. A strong, developmental story emerged around the England Women's Cricket World Cup campaign, covering their qualification for the semi-finals and anticipation of the next match. Articles related to England Men's T20 cricket, Rugby League, and Football (Latvia vs England, Socceroos) were de-noised as they represent distinct sports, teams, or separate series, making them irrelevant to the primary Women's World Cup narrative.",
