  "evaluation": "Initial inspection failed. While a potential continuous story about Super Typhoon Ragasa (articles 1, 3, 5, 7) was identified with 4 articles, another distinct potential story regarding Typhoon Halong (articles 4, 8) contained only 2 articles. According to the strict criteria, if any relevant extracted group has a size below 3, the entire cluster must be deemed 'Inadequate size' and cannot proceed to further validation steps. Therefore, no qualified developmental articles are returned.",
