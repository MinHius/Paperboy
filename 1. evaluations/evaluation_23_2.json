  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively forms a continuous and developmental story centered on the deteriorating and inhumane conditions within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities. The narrative begins with a report on the rising death toll in ICE custody, setting a grim context. Subsequent articles detail specific abuses and deprivations across various facilities: from a new California center described as a 'torture chamber,' to severe neglect of children in a Texas facility (with a direct follow-up providing further details), and targeted harassment and coerced labor of queer/trans immigrants in Louisiana, and even the psychological torment of perpetual lighting in a Washington facility. These articles provide specific examples and build a comprehensive picture of systemic issues. Articles focusing on protests outside facilities, military tactics in raids, and arrests of veterans, while related to ICE, were de-noised as they represent a distinct storyline about ICE enforcement actions and public resistance, rather than the internal conditions of detention centers.",
