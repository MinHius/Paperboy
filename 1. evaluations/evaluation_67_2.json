  "evaluation": "Initial inspection revealed that all articles are distinct, standalone personal essays or advice columns covering various topics such as career rejection, productivity hacks, loneliness, emotional processing, family dynamics, late-life self-discovery, relationships, and identity. There is no continuous or developmental narrative linking any three or more articles. Each article presents a self-contained story or reflection. Therefore, no group of articles meets the minimum size requirement of 3 for potential continuous stories, leading to an 'Inadequate size' assessment.",
