  "evaluation": "The core continuous story identified focuses on London's deepening housebuilding crisis and the controversial policy proposals to address it. Article 'society/2025/oct/20/sadiq-khan-act-fast-fix-london-housebuilding-emergency' sets the stage by highlighting the severe decline in new constructions in the capital, portraying it as an emergency. Following this, 'society/2025/oct/17/developers-higher-subsidies-fewer-affordable-homes-london' details the government's and London mayor's plans to allow developers higher subsidies and reduce affordable housing quotas, a proposed solution to the crisis. The immediate political reaction and opposition to these plans are captured in 'society/2025/oct/20/labour-mps-ministers-affordable-housing-london-sadiq-khan', where Labour MPs urge the reversal of these controversial measures. These articles are strictly relevant, time-continuous, and synthesizable into a coherent narrative about the London housing policy debate. Other articles were de-noised due to varying geographic scopes (Australia, EU), being general commentary/personal stories (homelessness), or focusing on different, albeit related, UK national planning policies (planning bill and environmental impact) that form a separate, distinct narrative not combinable under the 'one JSON object per cluster evaluation' rule.",
