  "topic": "UK immigration policy tightens as Tory figures call for mass deportations of legally settled families.",
  "story": "The United Kingdom's immigration landscape continues to face increasing scrutiny and a trend towards more stringent policies. Recently, new demands have emerged, requiring immigrants, including migrant NHS doctors, to demonstrate their 'contribution to society' through additional volunteer work to earn permanent settlement. Policies demanding a decade for citizenship or English A-levels are also becoming more commonplace, reflecting an escalating set of requirements for those seeking to remain in the UK.\n\nAdding to this contentious environment, Katie Lam, a prominent Home Office shadow minister and Conservative Party whip, has drawn widespread condemnation for her remarks regarding the deportation of legally settled families. Lam, described as a rising star within the party and a former special adviser to Boris Johnson, stated her belief that large numbers of people with legal status in the UK would need to have their right to stay revoked and should 'go home' to ensure the UK remains 'culturally coherent'.\n\nThe comments quickly ignited calls for condemnation, with many urging Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, who is considered a frontrunner for future party leadership, to denounce Lam's stance. However, Kemi Badenoch's spokesperson later confirmed that Lam's controversial views were 'broadly in line' with party policy, indicating a lack of distance from these proposals within the Conservative ranks.",
