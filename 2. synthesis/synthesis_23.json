  "story": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began his first formal meeting with Donald Trump in Washington D.C. on Monday, October 20. The visit drew commentary from former PM Malcolm Turnbull, who advised Albanese against being \"all over Trump like a cheap suit.\" During a meeting with Albanese the following day, former US President Trump reportedly told Ambassador Kevin Rudd, \"I don't like you either.\" Foreign Minister Penny Wong characterized the remark as \"clearly tongue-in-cheek,\" although Opposition Leader Sussan Ley initially questioned Rudd's \"tenable\" position as ambassador. Ley later retracted her calls for Rudd's dismissal on Wednesday. A significant outcome of Albanese's trip was the signing of an Australia-US rare earths deal, which caused share prices of critical mineral companies, including one with a stake held by Gina Rinehart, to rocket. The Prime Minister's journey was interrupted on Wednesday when his official jet made an unplanned stop in St. Louis, Missouri, following an accident involving an RAAF crew member.\n\nConcurrently, Australia faced escalating regional tensions with China. On Monday, the Australian government raised an \"unsafe and unprofessional\" South China Sea incident with the Chinese embassy. The situation intensified on Tuesday when China alleged an RAAF aircraft had \"illegally\" entered its airspace after a flares incident, claims addressed by Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy.\n\nDomestically, several key events unfolded. On Monday, Barnaby Joyce confirmed discussions with Pauline Hanson but stated that \"nothing is locked in\" regarding One Nation. South-east Tasmania experienced a bushfire emergency, with some residents advised it was \"too late to leave.\" Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan assured the public that police possessed the necessary resources and \"powers\" to manage violent protesters. By Wednesday, a New South Wales police officer was facing a second charge over the alleged assault of Hannah Thomas, and Victoria's police chief commissioner, Mike Bush, admitted to a \"wrong decision\" in relation to police actions. Additionally, Lidia Thorpe referred the Northern Territory's Attorney General, Marie-Claire Boothby, to the territory’s anti-corruption body.",
