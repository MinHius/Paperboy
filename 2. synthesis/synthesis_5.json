  "story": "The romantic comedy genre, long considered dormant, is experiencing a vibrant resurgence, with Netflix's \"Nobody Wants This\" at its forefront. The series, which returns for its second season on Thursday, October 23, delves into the complex relationship between Rabbi Noah, portrayed by Adam Brody, and relationship podcaster Joanne, played by Kristen Bell. The show's initial run garnered unexpected success by tackling the challenging dynamics of an interfaith relationship. Noah is a religious leader, while Joanne is an agnostic sex podcaster, a situation Noah's disapproving mother starkly highlights by calling Joanne a \"shiksa.\" The first season, set in Los Angeles, saw Joanne initially considering converting to Judaism for Noah, only to ultimately decide against it, recognizing the moral implications of adopting a faith for practical reasons. As the second season unfolds, viewers are left to wonder about the future of Noah and Joanne's unique love story. Key questions arise: Will Noah's family finally accept their inter-faith partnership? How will Joanne navigate Jewish traditions like Shabbat, a challenge she once comically noted with, \"Ooh! I love how shiny this bread is!\"? And can she continue her famously plain-speaking podcast alongside her relationship with a rabbi? \"Nobody Wants This\" continues to explore an important message of tolerance, underscored by its witty dialogue and strong on-screen chemistry.",
