  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a highly continuous and developmental narrative of the 2025 Ryder Cup. It logically progresses from pre-event discussions, including controversies over US player payments and Donald Trump's involvement, through live updates of Day 1 and Day 2, detailing Europe's strong performance and the US team's struggles. The story culminates with Europe retaining the cup on the final day. All articles are strictly relevant, informative, and form a coherent, synthesizable timeline of the event. The satirical piece, while distinct in tone, contributes to the overall media discourse around the event and is not considered noise.",
