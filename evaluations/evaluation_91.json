  "evaluation": "The primary continuous story focuses on Donald Trump's controversial speech at the UN General Assembly. This includes initial reports on the speech's content, further detailing of his accusations, a fact-check of his claims, and subsequent analyses and commentaries on his performance and rhetorical style. Articles pertaining to technical malfunctions during his visit ('triple sabotage') or his discussions on Ukraine, while occurring at the UN, were deemed separate incidents that did not form a developmental story of adequate size (below 3 articles) with the main speech narrative and were therefore moved to the noise list.",
