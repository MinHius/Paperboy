  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively traces the build-up to Rachel Reeves' Autumn Budget, detailing economic pressures, external policy recommendations from the CBI and Resolution Foundation, and Reeves' evolving public stance and key decisions during the Labour conference. Articles cover discussions on tax increases, fiscal responsibility, investment strategies, and the decision to lift the two-child benefit cap, leading to post-conference analysis of potential budget measures. Article 'politics/2025/sep/10/rachel-reeves-tells-private-equity-bosses-she-plans-to-shut-down-more-regulators' was deemed noise as it focuses on regulatory reform rather than the core budget/fiscal policy debate.",
