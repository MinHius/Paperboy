  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a strong, continuous, and developmental narrative around the 2025 Emmy Awards. It progresses logically from predictions (Sep 13), through live coverage and full winner lists on the night of the event (Sep 14), to post-event analysis, significant wins, and historical achievements (Sep 15). Articles focus on key winners like 'The Pitt,' 'The Studio,' and 'Adolescence,' and highlight moments such as Owen Cooper's historic win. Noise articles were removed for discussing unrelated film festivals/Oscars, climate change, or other non-Emmy entertainment news.",
