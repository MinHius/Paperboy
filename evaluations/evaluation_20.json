  "evaluation": "This cluster presents a robust and continuous narrative surrounding President Trump's highly controversial claims linking acetaminophen (Tylenol/paracetamol) use during pregnancy to autism. The story begins with a pre-announcement leak (Sep 21), progresses through the official announcement and immediate scientific backlash (Sep 22), widens to international expert and political condemnation (Sep 23-24), and concludes with an expert analysis debunking the administration's subsequent attempts to provide scientific justification (Oct 02). All articles are strictly relevant, developmental, and form a coherent, informative timeline without any noise.",
