  "evaluation": "The core cluster focuses on the 2025 AFL Grand Final between Geelong and Brisbane, providing a clear chronological narrative from pre-game guides to post-match analysis. The articles detail the anticipation, the live event, the final result, and immediate reactions to Brisbane's second consecutive premiership. Noise articles were removed as they covered preliminary/semi-final matches (which did not form a group of adequate size 3 or more) or were entirely irrelevant to the main Grand Final event (Adelaide Crows story). The remaining articles form a highly coherent and developmental story.",
