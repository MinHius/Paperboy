  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a comprehensive, continuous narrative of the 2025 AFL Grand Final, focusing on the Brisbane Lions' journey to their back-to-back premiership against the Geelong Cats. The articles chronologically cover the preliminary stages of the finals (Brisbane's semi-final win, Geelong's preliminary final win), leading to the Grand Final preview, live coverage, detailed match report, and post-game analysis of Brisbane's victory. The timeline is logical, starting from early September leading up to the Grand Final on September 27th and analysis on September 28th. One article concerning Adelaide's finals chances and the Phil Walsh story was de-noised as it was not directly relevant to the specific narrative of the Geelong vs. Brisbane Grand Final.",
