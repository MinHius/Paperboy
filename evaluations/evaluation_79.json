  "evaluation": "This cluster primarily features Donald Trump's controversial federal troop deployment to Portland, Oregon. Articles were de-noised by identifying a clear three-part narrative on Portland's events, which met the minimum size requirement for continuous, developmental stories. Other articles, while thematically related to federal intervention in cities, covered different cities (Memphis, Chicago, Washington DC) or broader military policy, and individually formed groups of less than three articles, thus failing the initial inspection's size criteria for continuous development. These were categorized as noise to focus on the strongest, most coherent narrative.",
