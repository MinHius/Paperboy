  "evaluation": "The cluster presents a strong continuous story about the deteriorating political landscape in Georgia. Article 1 establishes the initial claim of political vendetta and accusations of autocracy against the de facto leader, Bidzina Ivanishvili. Article 3 details a direct, punitive consequence—the freezing of bank accounts—against the family previously highlighted, serving as a clear development and reinforcement of the initial allegations. Article 7 expands the narrative by detailing jailed Georgian opposition leaders raising broader concerns about the ruling Georgian Dream party's conduct and international alignment, logically extending the 'autocracy' theme to a wider political context. Noise articles were removed as they discuss unrelated international or domestic issues.",
