  "evaluation": "This cluster focuses on Donald Trump's decision to increase H-1B visa fees to $100,000. The qualified articles detail the policy announcement, its anticipated negative impact on the US tech industry and economy, and the UK's strategic response to attract talent potentially deterred by the new US policy. This forms a clear, continuous, and developmental narrative. Other articles discussing various general tariff impacts, threats, or legal challenges were de-noised because they represented disparate events or broader policy impacts rather than a direct, evolving story tied to the H-1B visa fee increase. Their inclusion would fragment the primary narrative, making it less synthesizable and specific.",
