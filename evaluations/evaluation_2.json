  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively captures the continuous story of President Trump's decision to significantly increase H-1B visa fees. The articles detail the initial announcement of the $100,000 fee (us-news/2025/sep/20), its immediate impact and concerns within the US tech industry and economy (technology/2025/sep/22 and business/2025/sep/22/trump-h-1b-visa-fees-us-economy-tech-india), and the subsequent international reaction, specifically the UK's strategy to attract skilled workers in response (business/2025/sep/22/uk-visa-fee-cuts-trump-us-charges-h-1b-starmer). The articles deemed noise were primarily focused on various trade tariffs on goods or general legal challenges to tariffs, which are distinct from the H-1B visa fee policy and its specific implications.",
