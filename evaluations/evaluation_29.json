  "evaluation": "The core cluster focuses on London Fashion Week (LFW) in September 2025. Article 3 outlines LFW's strategic goals under new leadership. Article 8 details Burberry's significant show and financial recovery during LFW. Article 5 highlights the cultural importance of Black designers at LFW. These articles are de-noised from others covering different fashion weeks (Milan, New York, Paris, Manchester) or general fashion trends, ensuring a tight, continuous narrative about LFW. The timeline is logical, covering different aspects of the same event within the same period.",
