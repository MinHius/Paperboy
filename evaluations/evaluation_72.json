  "evaluation": "This cluster accurately tracks the continuous legal developments regarding President Trump's unprecedented attempt to remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook. The articles 'business/2025/sep/09/fed-governor-lisa-cook-trump-lawsuit', 'us-news/2025/sep/15/trump-lisa-cook-firing-court-declines', and 'us-news/2025/sep/18/trump-supreme-court-lisa-cook-fed' provide a clear, chronological narrative, detailing the initial judicial allowance for Cook to remain, the appeals court's refusal of Trump's request, and his subsequent escalation to the Supreme Court. These articles are highly relevant, developmental, and synthesizeable. Other articles were de-noised as they covered unrelated legal challenges, general political updates, or focused on separate Federal Reserve appointments, thus not contributing directly to this specific continuous story.",
