  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a strong, time-continuous story about the UK energy crisis. It begins with reports on rising household energy debt, includes an analysis of the underlying structural causes, builds up to the anticipated energy price cap increase on October 1st, and culminates with reports on the cap's impact and household coping strategies like rationing. Articles on mortgages, contactless payments, and ISAs were de-noised as they are irrelevant to the core narrative of energy costs and household financial struggles.",
