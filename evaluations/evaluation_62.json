  "evaluation": "The core topic focuses on the escalating UK energy debt crisis, its impact on households, and the context of the energy price cap. Articles detailing the rise in household energy debt (Art 1, 2), the increase of the energy price cap and its consequences (Art 3, 4, 6), practical advice for consumers (Art 5), and underlying structural causes like privatisation (Art 8) form a highly relevant and time-continuous narrative. Articles concerning mortgages (Art 7), contactless payments (Art 9), and ISAs/savings (Art 10) were de-noised as they address distinct financial topics, lacking direct relevance or developmental continuity with the energy crisis storyline.",
