  "evaluation": "This cluster accurately tracks Gout Gout's 200m journey at the World Athletics Championships. It begins with his pre-race readiness, moves to a heat preview, details his successful qualification for the semi-finals, previews his upcoming semi-final race, and concludes with his elimination. This forms a perfectly continuous and developmental narrative. Noise articles, while related to Gout Gout, focus on broader public interest, media hype, TV ratings, or general team context, and are therefore de-noised as they do not directly contribute to the progression of his specific 200m athletic performance.",
