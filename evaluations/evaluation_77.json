  "evaluation": "This cluster perfectly tracks Gout Gout's performance in the 200m at the World Athletics Championships. It starts with a preview of his heat, reports his qualification, previews his semi-final, and concludes with his elimination. The articles form a clear, logical, and time-continuous narrative of his competition. Articles focusing on general hype, pre-championship context, broader team coverage, or TV ratings were de-noised as they did not directly contribute to the sequential narrative of his competition performance.",
