  "evaluation": "The cluster was evaluated for continuous stories, identifying a primary narrative centered on the UK Labour government's internal struggles, leadership challenges, and policy developments during September 2025. This group of four articles passed the initial inspection for adequate size, demonstrated strong relevance and developmental progression in the data quality check, and met the criteria for a time-continuous, synthesizable, and informative story. Other articles, including those discussing the EU's future, general Liberal Democrat activities, public health, and the Gaza conflict with its international and domestic political reactions, were deemed irrelevant to this specific Labour-focused narrative and moved to the noise list to ensure strict thematic cohesion for the main story.",
