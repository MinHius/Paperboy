  "evaluation": "This cluster accurately tracks Ange Postecoglou's initial challenging period as Nottingham Forest's head coach. The narrative begins with his official appointment and public introduction, then logically progresses through a series of early defeats in the Premier League, Carabao Cup, and Europa League, culminating in significant fan discontent. Article 'football/2025/sep/09/nottingham-forest-part-company-with-head-coach-nuno-espirito-santo' was de-noised due to its redundancy with 'football/2025/sep/09/ange-postecoglou-appointed-nottingham-forest-head-coach-after-nuno-sacked', which provided a more comprehensive confirmation of his appointment. Article 'football/live/2025/sep/13/premier-league-returns-with-postecoglou-taking-nottingham-forest-to-arsenal-matchday-live', a brief live blog snippet, was also removed for being less informative and detailed than the dedicated match reports and Postecoglou's direct quotes present in other articles.",
