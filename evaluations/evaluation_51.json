  "evaluation": "The core story revolves around the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, including irregular deportations, family separations, and threats against advocacy groups, alongside the numerous legal challenges and varied judicial rulings that these policies have faced. Articles were de-noised if they focused on broader political events not directly tied to specific immigration policies (e.g., the DC takeover) or provided historical context for refugee communities rather than unfolding policy/legal developments.",
