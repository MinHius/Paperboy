  "evaluation": "This cluster presents a strong, continuous story focusing on the platforming of far-right extremism in Australia and its repercussions. It tracks the controversy surrounding neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell, his alleged attack, and Sky News Australia giving him a platform (Articles 7, 1, 8). It then develops into another significant Sky News controversy involving an anti-Islam guest, detailing the editorial failure, staff involvement, and the eventual axing of the program (Articles 3, 5, 6). Article 9 broadens the discussion to the amplification of extremist figures like Sewell through social media algorithms, reinforcing the overarching theme. Articles concerning general neo-Nazi trends (Article 4), broader extremism within the ADF (Article 2), or personal experiences with racism (Article 10) were de-noised as they did not directly contribute to the specific, developmental narrative of these platforming incidents and their direct consequences.",
