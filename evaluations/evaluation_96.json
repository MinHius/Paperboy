  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively tracks the announcement and initial reception of Keir Starmer's proposed UK digital ID scheme. The articles comprehensively cover the plan's details, rationale, historical context, immediate political reactions, and significant concerns regarding civil liberties and cybersecurity. Article 'politics/live/2025/sep/25/andy-burnham-steve-reed-keir-starmer-labour-news-updates-uk-politics-live' was de-noised as it discusses an unrelated political dispute between Starmer and Andy Burnham. Article 'commentisfree/2025/sep/26/digital-id-cards-reform-government-civil-liberties-trump-america' was also de-noised as it offers a broader political critique of Starmer's immigration stance, rather than directly developing the digital ID story. The remaining articles form a highly cohesive, time-continuous narrative suitable for synthesis.",
