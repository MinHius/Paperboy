  "evaluation": "The core cluster effectively covers Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK, detailing its anticipation, arrival, key events, economic outcomes, and conclusion in a logical, chronological sequence from September 9th to 19th. The articles are highly relevant, developmental, and informative, providing significant coverage of diplomatic, political, economic, and security aspects. Article 'politics/2025/sep/15/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-keir-starmer-peter-mandelson' was de-noised as its primary focus on the Peter Mandelson scandal and its impact on Keir Starmer's government, while occurring during the visit, is a domestic political crisis that only tangentially relates to the developmental story of the state visit itself. Its inclusion would divert from the core narrative of Trump's visit.",
