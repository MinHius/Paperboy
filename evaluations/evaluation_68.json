  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a comprehensive and chronological account of Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK. It effectively covers the pre-visit preparations, the detailed agenda, his arrival, key official engagements, significant economic announcements like the £150bn investment, and public protests, concluding with a post-visit summary. Articles were de-noised if they focused on tangential political scandals (Mandelson/Epstein), broad analyses of Trump's character, or the wider influence of his political style on the British right, as these did not directly contribute to the factual, developmental timeline of the state visit's events and outcomes.",
