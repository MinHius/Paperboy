  "evaluation": "This cluster accurately captures the continuous story of the UN Commission of Inquiry's finding that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. The core articles announce and detail the report, while subsequent pieces track political reactions and commentary from various international actors, including US senators, Australian officials, and the UK Labour party. The timeline is logical, showing the report's initial release followed by developing international responses. Articles concerning Mahmoud Abbas's UNGA speech and an earlier report by US senators on 'ethnic cleansing' were de-noised because they address distinct events and do not directly advance the narrative of the UN COI's specific findings and their immediate aftermath.",
