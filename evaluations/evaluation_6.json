  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively traces the progression of the Labour deputy leadership contest. It begins by outlining the initial contenders and nomination process, details Bridget Phillipson's declaration, tracks the narrowing of the field as other candidates withdrew (including Emily Thornberry and Alison McGovern), and culminates with the two final contenders, Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell, officially launching their campaigns. Noise articles, primarily opinion pieces discussing the role or implications of the leadership, or a news report on a candidate who subsequently withdrew, were de-noised to maintain strict relevance and ensure a continuous, developmental narrative of the evolving race.",
