  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a coherent and developmental story around sustainable living and reducing plastic waste. Article 10 from September 9th sets the context with global plastic issues and reader-submitted sustainable swaps. Articles 3 and 4, both from September 18th, follow up with broader tips for sustainable living and specific steps to reduce plastic waste at home. This progression from context and reader experience to practical guides makes the story informative and logical. Articles about dishwasher loading, home winter preparation, and garden autumn preparation were deemed noise due to irrelevance or inadequate size (less than 3 articles). The article on knitwear care was also de-noised as its advice on storing winter clothes for warmer weather contradicted the autumn/winter preparation theme of other potentially related fashion articles.",
