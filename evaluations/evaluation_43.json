  "evaluation": "The identified core articles form a strong continuous story on sustainable living, specifically focusing on reducing plastic waste. 'Sustainable swaps' (thefilter/2025/sep/09/sustainable-swaps-that-worked-readers) sets the stage with reader tips and the individual's role in plastic reduction. This is logically followed by broader 'sustainable living tips' (waste-no-space/2025/sep/18/sustainable-living-tips-small-changes-big-impact) and a focused guide on 'how to reduce plastic waste at home' (waste-no-space/2025/sep/18/how-to-reduce-plastic-waste-at-home-simple-steps). These three are highly relevant, informative, and provide significant coverage with a logical timeline for synthesis. Other articles were de-noised due to failing the initial inspection's group size requirement (e.g., dishwasher loading tips, home/garden winter prep) or for lack of strict relevance and developmental potential within a coherent story (e.g., transitional fashion and garment care, where garment care was an outlier, reducing the fashion group below the minimum size).",
