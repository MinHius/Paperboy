  "evaluation": "The core cluster of articles effectively chronicles the tragic Lisbon funicular crash, providing immediate reports of casualties, public reaction, subsequent identification of victims, and progress of the official investigation including preliminary findings about the cable failure. The articles demonstrate clear chronological and thematic development. An opinion piece reflecting on the incident was de-noised as it did not constitute a direct news development suitable for a continuous story narrative. A completely unrelated article about a bus crash in London was also removed as noise.",
