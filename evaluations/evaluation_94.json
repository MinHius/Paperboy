  "evaluation": "The core cluster effectively covers the Lisbon funicular crash, starting from initial reports of casualties and official reactions, progressing through victim identification (including British nationals), local public sentiment, and culminating in the crucial investigative finding that a cable snapped. This forms a clear, continuous, and developmental narrative. Article 10 was de-noised as it describes an entirely unrelated bus crash in London. Articles 3 (opinion piece) and 8 (explainer) were de-noised because, while contextually related, they do not constitute direct developmental news updates to the ongoing story of the crash, its victims, or investigation, as per the strict criteria for continuous stories.",
