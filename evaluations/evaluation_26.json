  "evaluation": "This cluster focuses on Arsenal's recent football matches between mid-September and early October 2025. The core articles detail post-match comments from manager Mikel Arteta and key players like Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli following Champions League and Premier League fixtures. These articles are highly relevant as they track Arsenal's performance and internal reactions over a continuous period, offering insights into their form, challenges, and successes. All articles not pertaining to Arsenal's specific matches and direct commentary were de-noised, as they covered other teams and unrelated fixtures, preventing the formation of a cohesive, single-team narrative.",
