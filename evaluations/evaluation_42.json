  "evaluation": "Initial inspection determined that all articles are standalone reviews of distinct cultural productions (films, plays, opera, documentary). No group of three or more articles exhibited continuous or developmental storytelling regarding a single evolving topic or event. Therefore, no qualified cluster could be formed, and all articles are categorized as noise due to inadequate size for a continuous narrative.",
