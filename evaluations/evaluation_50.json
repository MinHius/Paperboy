  "evaluation": "This cluster focuses on the evolving diplomatic and military aid relationship between the United States and Ukraine, specifically involving President Trump. It begins with Zelenskyy's efforts to engage Trump on influencing international powers, progresses to concrete discussions about significant US arms and drone deals following a meeting with Trump, acknowledges the ongoing challenges in securing punitive sanctions from Trump, and culminates with Russia's direct warnings regarding the potential supply of advanced US missiles. Articles concerning general UNGA proceedings, isolated battlefield reports, specific border incidents, or other energy-related attacks (unconnected to the US aid narrative) were de-noised as they did not directly contribute to this continuous, developmental story of US-Ukraine military-diplomatic engagement.",
