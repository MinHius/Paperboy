  "evaluation": "This cluster focuses strictly on the evolving pressure and subsequent decisions concerning Israel's participation in international football competitions by governing bodies like FIFA and UEFA. Articles pertaining to EU trade sanctions and Eurovision participation were de-noised as they represent distinct, albeit related by the broader theme of 'international pressure on Israel', and are not direct, developmental narratives of the football story. The selected articles form a clear, chronological, and synthesizable narrative on the specific topic of football sanctions.",
