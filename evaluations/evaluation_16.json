  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively captures a continuous story centered around Rachel Roddy's recipe contributions and food writing. All selected articles are either direct recipes or discussions about her ongoing work as a food writer, creating a cohesive narrative. The inclusion of 'food/2025/sep/23/feast-everyday-hero-weekly-recipes-rachel-roddy' further contextualizes her regular contributions, indicating developmental potential as her book with 120 recipes is mentioned. Noise articles were de-noised due to featuring different authors, distinct thematic focuses (e.g., zero-waste cooking), or being multi-author recipe compilations that do not fit the strict continuous story requirement for a single author.",
