  "evaluation": "This cluster of articles focuses on Rachel Roddy's continuous contributions to everyday cooking. Article 'feast-everyday-hero-weekly-recipes-rachel-roddy' explicitly frames the narrative around the challenge of finding 'week-in, week-out meal suggestions', making the preceding and subsequent recipes ('parcel-baked-fish', 'lasagne', 'store-cupboard-spaghetti', 'pizzette') highly relevant as practical solutions and examples within her column. The other articles by different authors or on disparate themes (e.g., specific event recipes, zero-waste tips by other writers, different author recipes) were de-noised due to lacking direct continuity or developmental narrative with Roddy's specific series.",
