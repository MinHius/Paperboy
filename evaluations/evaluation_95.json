  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively captures the continuous story of the Men's Singles tournament at the US Open 2025. The articles clearly track the progression from Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner's semi-final victories to their climactic final match, culminating in Alcaraz's win. The timeline is logical and developmental. Articles pertaining to the Women's Singles tournament, while part of the same overall event, were de-noised as they represent a separate narrative and do not directly contribute to the specific continuous story of the Men's final.",
