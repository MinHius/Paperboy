  "evaluation": "Initial inspection failed due to inadequate size. The articles represent distinct subject-specific university league tables published on the same date. They do not form a single continuous or developmental news story. Each article is a standalone report rather than a progression of a narrative. Furthermore, the full_text for all articles was empty, preventing any content-based validation of continuity, development, relevance, or synthesizability.",
