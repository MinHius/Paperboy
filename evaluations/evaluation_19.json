  "evaluation": "Initial inspection revealed all articles have empty full_text content, preventing any assessment of continuity, development, or relevance based on textual analysis. Although all articles pertain to 'Best UK Universities for [Subject] League Table' published on the same date, they represent distinct subject rankings, not a continuous or developmental narrative about a single story or ranking process. As no group of 3 or more articles could be identified as a continuous, developmental story due to lack of content and distinct topics, all articles are designated as noise for the purpose of synthesis.",
