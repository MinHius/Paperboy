  "evaluation": "The cluster focuses on the evolving challenges of modern dating. It identifies a developmental story covering macro trends of increasing single women, the specific frustrations of dating app usage, and a call for real-world bad first date experiences. These articles provide a comprehensive, albeit multi-faceted, look into contemporary dating issues. Articles addressing individual personal sex/relationship advice, geopolitical gender conflicts, pop culture relationship concepts, or AI technology were deemed irrelevant to this core, cohesive theme and moved to the noise list. The articles selected for the main story are highly relevant, informative, and logically sequenced, supporting synthesis.",
