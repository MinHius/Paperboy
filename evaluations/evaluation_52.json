  "evaluation": "The core cluster focuses on distinct yet related sexual and intimacy problems within relationships, presented as advice column queries. Articles were de-noised to remove those that were broader societal trends (single women, dating apps), an experiential narrative (differing libidos), a pop culture commentary (swag gap), a callout for reader submissions (bad first dates), and entirely unrelated topics (AI toy, South Korea gender war). The remaining articles are strictly relevant, developmental in exploring different facets of relationship intimacy struggles, and highly synthesizable as a collection of common relationship challenges.",
