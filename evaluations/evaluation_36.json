  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively tracks the unfolding story of the deadly shooting at the Dallas ICE facility. The articles provide a continuous narrative, detailing the initial incident, the identification of the shooter (Joshua Jahn), and subsequently naming the three immigrant detainees who were shot, including the one fatality. These articles demonstrate clear developmental potential and a logical timeline (Sep 24-26). Other articles discussing different ICE-related incidents such as general detention conditions (e.g., Dilley, which did not meet the minimum article count for a continuous story), officer misconduct, policy changes, or unrelated detainee deaths were de-noised due to their irrelevance to this specific continuous event.",
