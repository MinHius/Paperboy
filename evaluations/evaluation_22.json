  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively tracks the continuous story of the internal dispute between Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana regarding the launch of their new leftwing party's membership portal. The articles cover the initial split, legal threats, de-escalation attempts, and the subsequent unilateral moves to launch. Noise articles were de-noised as they focused on external impacts (Green Party membership surge) or broader political commentary rather than direct developments of the core conflict.",
