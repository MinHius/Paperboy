  "evaluation": "The cluster consists of ten distinct personal narratives, each detailing an individual's unique life change, experience, or awakening. No articles were found to be continuous or developmental with each other, meaning there is no single evolving story arc across three or more articles. Consequently, the initial inspection determined 'Inadequate size', and no qualified groups suitable for synthesis were identified. All articles are categorized as noise.",
