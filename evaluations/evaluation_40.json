  "evaluation": "The core cluster consists of articles explicitly belonging to 'The one change that worked' series, showcasing diverse first-person accounts of significant personal transformations. These articles are continuous in their thematic approach and developmental in exploring various facets of self-improvement over time. Other articles were de-noised as they either represented standalone pieces, incomplete series (less than 3 articles), or had entirely irrelevant subject matter (e.g., robot massage, scam text).",
