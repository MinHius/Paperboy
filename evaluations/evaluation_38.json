  "evaluation": "This cluster details the NSW government's initiatives to address the housing crisis through a planning system overhaul, including specific development plans and local council actions. It also covers the subsequent concerns raised by environmental groups regarding the broad implications of these fast-tracking laws. Articles on Sydney tolls, airport development, UK planning, Manchester housing, Sydney climate, and Melbourne public housing were de-noised due to irrelevance to the core NSW housing planning narrative.",
