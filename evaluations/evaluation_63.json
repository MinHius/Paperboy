  "evaluation": "The main story centers on the unfolding debate and policy decisions surrounding shark nets in Australia. This includes the immediate aftermath of a fatal shark attack in New South Wales leading to the pause of a net reduction trial, and a series of whale entanglements in Queensland's shark nets prompting the Premier to reaffirm his commitment to the program despite environmental concerns and scientific explanations. Article 'environment/2025/sep/25/can-bite-resistant-wetsuits-help-protect-surfers-against-sharks-heres-what-australian-researchers-have-found' was de-noised as it discusses a general shark bite prevention method (wetsuits) and does not directly contribute to the continuous narrative of incidents, policy responses, or the core debate surrounding shark nets. Articles 'environment/2025/sep/30/fish-killer-problem-shark-dna-caribbean-scientists-cull-aoe' and 'australia-news/2025/sep/13/queensland-locust-plague-qld-spider-venom' were de-noised for being entirely irrelevant, one covering shark incidents in the Caribbean and the other a locust plague.",
