  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively tracks the continuous and developmental story of protests against the Palestine Action ban. It begins with initial mass arrests in London, progresses to the announcement of a 'week of action' including protests at the Labour conference, details specific arrests at that conference, and concludes with the build-up to a large planned London protest and the police's request for its postponement. Articles focusing on the legal challenge to the ban, the impact on prisoners, or internal Labour party debates were de-noised as they deviate from the direct narrative of organized protests and arrests.",
