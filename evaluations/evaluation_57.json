  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a strong, continuous narrative regarding the Trump administration's military actions against alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers in the Caribbean. The articles detail initial strikes, subsequent deployments, political implications, regional perspectives, internal administration roles, and the evolving legal justifications. Article 'society/2025/sep/04/fentanyl-guns-us-mexico-border-arizona-california' was de-noised as it focuses on fentanyl and gun trafficking at the US-Mexico border, which is entirely separate and irrelevant to the Caribbean military operations.",
