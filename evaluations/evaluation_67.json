  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a strong, developmental narrative around the theme of youth delinquency and rehabilitation. Article 5 details a personal mentorship approach in the 1980s, Article 8 focuses on a residential reform school in the mid-2000s, and Article 6 exposes the contemporary 'troubled teen industry'. These articles offer different facets and timeframes of the same societal issue, making them highly relevant and synthesizable. All other articles were denoised as they covered unrelated film or music reviews, or different TV series topics.",
