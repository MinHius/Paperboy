  "evaluation": "The core cluster effectively captures the continuous story of Robert Redford's death, beginning with the initial news and official obituaries on September 16, followed by immediate and subsequent tributes from fellow actors, filmmakers, and institutions over the following days. Articles were de-noised if they were opinion/feature pieces analyzing his career, personal anecdotes from readers, or meta-commentary critiquing other articles, as these did not directly contribute to the developmental news narrative of his passing and its immediate aftermath. The selected articles provide informative and significant coverage, with a logical timeline reflecting the unfolding story of his death and the widespread reactions.",
