  "evaluation": "This cluster accurately identifies a continuous and developmental story regarding the Taliban's escalating internet shutdown in Afghanistan. The selected articles (ID: global-development/2025/sep/23, world/2025/sep/30, commentisfree/2025/oct/01) provide a clear, logical timeline: from initial regional restrictions in mid-September, through gradual nationwide weakening of services, to a sweeping national blackout ordered on October 1st. They are strictly relevant, synthesizable, and cover the event's progression and impact. Other articles, while some relate to Afghanistan (women's struggles with sport or education), are considered noise as they do not directly contribute to the specific, time-continuous narrative of the internet shutdown. Articles on South Sudan, Malawi, and Gaza are entirely irrelevant to this story.",
