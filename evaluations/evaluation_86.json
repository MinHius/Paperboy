  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively tracks the Taliban's progressive internet and communications blackout in Afghanistan. Article 'global-development/2025/sep/23/taliban-afghanistan-internet-shutdown-women-girls-education-hope' reports initial regional shutdowns impacting online education. Article 'world/2025/sep/30/afghanistan-mobile-phones-internet-telecoms-blackout-taliban' details the subsequent nationwide escalation of the blackout. Article 'commentisfree/2025/oct/01/afghanistan-internet-shutdown-taliban-calculated-effort-consolidate-power-silence-dissent' provides broader context on the Taliban's motives, linking it to consolidating power and silencing dissent. The timeline is logical, showing a clear development of the story. Other articles were de-noised due to unrelated geographical focus (Sudan, South Sudan, Malawi, Gaza) or different thematic focuses on Afghan women's lives (sports, general education restrictions) not directly tied to the internet crackdown.",
