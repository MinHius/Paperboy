  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a comprehensive, time-continuous story detailing Graham Potter's increasing pressure at West Ham, the club's indecision regarding his future, the specific matches that fueled the crisis, the consideration of replacements like Nuno Espírito Santo and Slaven Bilic, and his eventual sacking with Nuno's appointment. The narrative logically progresses from mounting pressure and poor results, through the board's deliberations, to the final decision and subsequent reflection on the club's state. Articles 8 and 10 were denoised as they were general live blogs or summaries of other matches or events, lacking specific developmental content for this core managerial narrative.",
