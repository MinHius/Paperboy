  "evaluation": "The articles form a highly coherent and time-continuous story detailing Graham Potter's increasing pressure at West Ham, the critical Crystal Palace defeat, the board's deliberation and indecision, his eventual sacking, and the immediate appointment of Nuno Espírito Santo, followed by a retrospective analysis of the club's issues. Noise articles include general live match updates and a match report from an earlier game against Tottenham, which, while contextual to Potter's poor form, is not directly developmental to the specific sacking narrative that intensified after the Crystal Palace loss.",
