  "evaluation": "The cluster comprehensively covers the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner due to a breach of the ministerial code over stamp duty. Articles dated September 5th detail the initial crisis, the ethics adviser's findings, Rayner's resignation, the immediate political fallout for Labour and Keir Starmer, and the major cabinet reshuffle. Subsequent articles from September 6th logically develop the story by covering the search for her replacement as Deputy Labour Leader and further ministerial appointments. All articles are highly relevant, developmental, and present a coherent, time-continuous narrative suitable for synthesis. No articles were deemed irrelevant or noisy.",
