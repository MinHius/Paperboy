  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively details the unfolding 'Boris Files' scandal. Articles introduce the leak, explain its contents, detail specific instances of Johnson's alleged post-premiership financial misconduct (lobbying, paid speeches, use of public funds), and cover the political fallout and investigations. Article 'uk-news/2025/sep/10/washington-post-boss-will-lewis-secret-adviser-boris-johnson-leak' was de-noised as it focuses on a separate individual's conduct, even if revealed by the same leak, rather than Johnson's direct financial activities or misuse of office for personal gain.",
