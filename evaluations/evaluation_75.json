  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively details the unfolding scandal surrounding Boris Johnson's post-premiership financial activities and alleged ethics breaches, as revealed by a leak dubbed the 'Boris Files'. The articles cohesively cover the initial revelations, provide specific examples of lobbying and paid speeches, discuss the misuse of taxpayer-funded office resources, and report on the political and ethical backlash. The timeline is logical, starting with the initial exposé and progressing through specific developments and reactions. Article 'uk-news/2025/sep/10/washington-post-boss-will-lewis-secret-adviser-boris-johnson-leak' was de-noised because its primary focus is on Will Lewis's conduct as an adviser during Johnson's time as PM, not Johnson's post-premiership financial dealings, making it tangential to the core narrative.",
