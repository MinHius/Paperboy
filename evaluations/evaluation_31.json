  "evaluation": "The cluster provides a robust and continuous narrative on the Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace on September 9-10, 2025, and the subsequent national, diplomatic, and alliance responses. The story develops chronologically from the initial incident and Poland's immediate defensive actions, through UN Security Council requests and Nato's enhanced defense commitments, culminating in a foreign minister's assessment of Russia's intent. Articles identified as noise were either redundant summaries of events already covered in more comprehensive reports (e.g., live blog closings, analysis pieces reiterating facts) or described a distinct, albeit related, incident (Polish aircraft deployment on September 20 due to airstrikes near the Ukrainian border, not an airspace incursion itself). The qualified articles are highly relevant, developmental, informative, and provide significant coverage, creating a logical and synthesizable story arc.",
