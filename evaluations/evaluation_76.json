  "evaluation": "The cluster successfully identifies a continuous story about UEFA's decision-making regarding playing domestic league matches abroad. Article 'football/2025/sep/06/...' sets the stage by detailing the imminent, crucial decision. Article 'football/2025/sep/11/...' then reports on UEFA's actual decision to delay and consult, directly following the previous anticipation. Article 'football/2025/sep/14/...' provides a deeper analysis of UEFA backing off and the ongoing power struggle, further developing the narrative. Other articles were de-noised as they either covered unrelated sports topics (e.g., County Championship restructure, Super League playoffs/expansion, WSL inclusivity) or did not form a developmental group of adequate size (less than 3 articles). The identified story is strictly relevant, time-continuous, and synthesizeable.",
