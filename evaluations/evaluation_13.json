  "evaluation": "The cluster primarily focuses on the multifaceted impact of Artificial Intelligence on human employment and creative industries. Articles detail specific instances of job displacement in banking and subtitling, broader ethical concerns regarding AI training data infringing on creative livelihoods, the backlash against AI actors, and a personal account of AI's perceived influence on writing professions. Articles concerning AI's capabilities in disease prediction, self-awareness, or forecasting, as well as educational responses to AI, were de-noised as they did not directly contribute to the core, continuous narrative of AI-driven job displacement and economic threat to human work and creativity.",
