  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively captures the continuous and developing story of AI's pervasive impact on various job sectors and creative industries. The core narrative revolves around job displacement (banking, subtitling, acting, writing), the ethical implications of AI training data (copyright infringement impacting creators' livelihoods), and the broader societal discussion on future employment and education in an AI-driven world. The articles are strictly relevant, demonstrating a logical progression of events and discussions from early September to early October 2025. Noise articles were removed for focusing on distinct aspects of AI, such as medical applications, AI model capabilities, psychological impacts, or competitive performance, which do not contribute to the narrative of AI's impact on employment and creativity.",
