  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a highly continuous and developmental narrative tracking the significant controversy surrounding Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership as HHS Secretary. Articles cover his questioned vaccine policies, the resulting turmoil at the CDC, the firing of director Susan Monarez, multiple Senate hearings where officials testified against his actions, strong public and expert criticism, and related policy developments like the ACIP vote. The timeline is logical, showcasing the escalation and multifaceted impact of his tenure. No articles were deemed noise as all contribute directly to the central, evolving story.",
