  "evaluation": "The main story follows Zohran Mamdani's New York City mayoral campaign in September 2025, detailing his strong poll lead, significant endorsement from Governor Kathy Hochul, controversial policy stances, external political interference attempts, and challenges from wealthy opponents. Noisy articles were removed for being either broad political analyses using Mamdani as an example, focusing on his personal biography/identity without direct campaign relevance, or being opinion pieces rather than direct campaign reporting. The remaining articles provide a continuous and developmental narrative of his campaign's progress, challenges, and public engagement, with a logical timeline of events through the month.",
