  "evaluation": "The cluster successfully identifies a continuous, developmental story centered around the 'Australian Bird of the Year 2025' event. The articles track the poll's announcement and call for nominations (Sep 14), followed by public engagement activities such as the release of colouring sheets (Sep 16) and an origami guide (Sep 27). These articles are strictly relevant, informative, and show a logical progression over time, making them highly synthesizable. Noise articles were removed because they cover unrelated topics like pets on flights, specific bird/animal conservation efforts not tied to the 'Bird of the Year' event, general birdwatching, or a different country's 'Bird of the Year' competition.",
