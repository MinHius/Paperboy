  "evaluation": "This cluster successfully identifies a continuous story focusing on the Australian Bird of the Year 2025 poll. The articles detail the poll's introduction, nomination process, and public engagement activities, such as craft guides and colouring sheets, providing a clear and logical progression of event coverage. Noise articles were removed due to irrelevance, covering topics like pet travel, unrelated bird conservation efforts, general birdwatching, marine mammal conservation, or bird of the year events from different countries (New Zealand), which do not form a continuous narrative with the Australian poll.",
