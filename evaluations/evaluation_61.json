  "evaluation": "The cluster provides a continuous and developmental story on the evolving challenges within the UK economy. Articles cover reports on a slowing jobs market, persistent inflation, rising government borrowing, and declining business confidence. The Bank of England's monetary policy and forecasts from major economic bodies like the OECD and businesses such as Next offer critical context and future outlook. Article 'business/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-remained-at-38-in-august-official-figures-show' was de-noised due to its redundancy with 'business/live/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-steady-38-in-july-official-figures-federal-reserve-interest-rates-donald-trump-state-visit-business-live' as both report the same August inflation figures on the same day. Article 'business/live/2025/sep/24/markets-economy-gold-eli-lilly-drug-prices-business-live-news' was deemed noise as its specific focus on pharmaceutical drug pricing is not directly relevant to the broader macroeconomic narrative of the UK's financial health.",
