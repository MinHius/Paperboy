  "evaluation": "This cluster provides a strong, continuous narrative detailing the evolving US-China TikTok deal. The articles chronologically outline the initial framework agreement, presidential announcements, Xi Jinping's approval, the signing of an executive order, the naming of key investors (Oracle, Murdochs), the deal's structure, and the final inclusion of an Abu Dhabi royal family stake. Article 5 was de-noised due to its high redundancy with Article 4, providing virtually identical information on the same day without adding new, unique developmental content essential for synthesis.",
