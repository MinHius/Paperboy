  "evaluation": "Initial inspection identified a potential group of 3 articles discussing the rise of the far-right and societal responses (politics/2025/sep/23/your-party-is-offering-a-gift-to-the-hard-right, world/2025/sep/21/labour-should-draw-strength-from-the-principled-majority, politics/2025/sep/17/a-wake-up-call-for-all-of-us-to-resist-the-far-right). This passed the initial 'Adequate' size requirement. However, upon stricter data quality review for continuous, developmental, and strictly relevant narratives, article 'politics/2025/sep/23/your-party-is-offering-a-gift-to-the-hard-right' was deemed tangential. Its primary focus was the internal failings of a specific political party, with the far-right's ascendancy serving as a contextual backdrop rather than being directly about far-right activities or counter-mobilization efforts as seen in the other two articles. This de-noising reduced the potential group to 2 articles, which falls below the minimum size of 3 required for a 'continuous story.' Consequently, no group met the criteria for being developmental, strictly relevant, and synthesizable for a continuous narrative, resulting in all articles being classified as noise.",
