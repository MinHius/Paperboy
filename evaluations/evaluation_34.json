  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively tracks the developing narrative around the rise of far-right movements in the UK. It begins with a direct reaction to a specific far-right march (ID: politics/2025/sep/17), then broadens to discuss the nature of right-wing extra-parliamentary mobilization and nationalist rallies (ID: world/2025/sep/21), concluding with a political critique of a party's inaction amidst this ascendancy (ID: politics/2025/sep/23). The timeline is logical and shows a clear progression of public and political discourse on the topic. All other articles were de-noised as they discussed unrelated topics such as child poverty, public health regulation, consumer ethics, personal grief, AI deepfakes, medical tribunal reforms, and tube strikes.",
