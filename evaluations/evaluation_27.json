  "evaluation": "The cluster strongly covers the initial stages of a US government shutdown, from its lead-up due to healthcare disputes and political stalemates (Sept 12, Sept 30) to its initiation (Oct 01) and the immediate developments on its second day (Oct 02). Key aspects include the political blame game, impact on federal workers, and the Trump administration's retaliatory actions and rhetoric. Article 'us-news/live/2025/oct/02/government-shutdown-trump-democrats-latest-updates' was de-noised as it contained tangential information about unrelated events (Portland arson video) and general administration updates, lacking direct developmental relevance to the shutdown narrative.",
