  "evaluation": "The core story tracks the release and impact of Australia's national climate risk assessment report. It begins with the report's initial announcement and summary (Sep 15), followed by immediate analysis, local illustrative impacts (Sydney's west), and the government's policy response regarding the 2035 emissions target (Sep 16-18). The story concludes with a follow-up article reinforcing the report's findings and tools (Sep 25), showing a clear, continuous development. Noise articles were removed for being either too broad in scope (global fossil fuel production, global wildfires), focusing on a distinct, unrelated topic (eco-anxiety in Fiji), or being a mere mention within a general news digest article with extensive irrelevant content.",
