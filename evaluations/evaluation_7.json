  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively traces the story of Australia's national climate risk assessment report, from its release and key findings, through the government's advocacy for a strong 2035 emissions target, to local-level impacts and subsequent media analysis. The articles are chronologically logical and developmentally connected. Articles on global fossil fuel extraction, global wildfires, and eco-anxiety in Fiji were de-noised as they lacked specific relevance to Australia's national report and policy response, falling outside the focused narrative.",
