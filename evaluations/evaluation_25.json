  "evaluation": "This cluster effectively tracks the continuous story of Jair Bolsonaro's coup trial and conviction in Brazil. Articles progress from pre-verdict anticipation, through the judicial process and final sentencing, to immediate public reaction and political analysis. Noise articles include a profile piece on the judge (world/2025/sep/08/judge-alexandre-de-moraes-jair-bolsonaro-trial), a completely unrelated international legal case (world/2025/sep/25/nicolas-sarkozy-found-guilty-of-criminal-conspiracy-in-libya-trial), and a separate legal ruling against Bolsonaro for racist remarks (world/2025/sep/16/bolsonaro-damages-brazil) which, while involving Bolsonaro, is not a direct development of the coup trial narrative.",
