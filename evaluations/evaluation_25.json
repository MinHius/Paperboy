  "evaluation": "This cluster successfully captures the continuous and developmental story of Jair Bolsonaro's coup trial. The articles logically progress from the lead-up and final stages of the trial (Sep 7, 9) to the definitive conviction and sentencing (Sep 11), followed by an explainer, public reactions, and political analysis (Sep 11, 12). Noise articles were removed for being entirely irrelevant (Sarkozy trial), covering a separate legal matter concerning Bolsonaro (racist remarks damages), or focusing on a human interest aspect of a key figure rather than the direct progression of the coup storyline (Judge Moraes's celebrity).",
